## Description
ByteChat is a real-time chat application demonstrating the use of WebSockets in a Go backend. The application features a server-side rendered frontend using `templ` and HTMX for dynamic updates.

The primary motivation for this project was to explore and implement a clean WebSocket solution in Go for real-time communication, supporting both public chat rooms and private(peer to peer) interactions.

## Key Features ‚ú®

* **Real-Time Communication**: Built using webSockets for instant, bidirectional messaging between users.
* **Go Backend**: Leverages Go's performance, concurrency features, and strong typing for a reliable backend.
* **Server-Side HTML Rendering**: Uses `templ` for type-safe Go components rendered to HTML on the server.
* **Dynamic Frontend Updates**: Utilizes HTMX for WebSocket communication and seamless partial page updates without full page reloads.
* **Secure User Authentication**: Implements session management using cryptographically signed, HTTP-only cookies.
* **Message Persistence**: Stores user data, room information, and chat messages in a PostgreSQL database.
* **Database Migrations**: Uses `goose` for managing database schema changes.
* **Dockerized Deployment**: Comes with `docker-compose` for easy setup and deployment.

## Tech Stack üõ†Ô∏è

* **Backend**: Go (Golang)
* **Web Framework/Routing**: `https://go-chi.io/#/`
* **WebSockets**: `https://github.com/coder/websocket` (websocket)
* **Templating**: `templ` (`https://templ.guide/`)
* **Frontend Interaction**: HTMX (`https://htmx.org/docs/#introduction`)
* **Database**: PostgreSQL
* **Migrations**: `goose` (`https://github.com/pressly/goose`)
* **Containerization**: Docker & Docker Compose

## Prerequisites üìã

* Go (version 1.21 or later recommended)
* PostgreSQL Server
* Docker & Docker Compose
* `make` (for using Makefile commands)
* `goose` CLI (The application has manages migration automatically)
