## Description
ByteChat is a real-time chat application with a backend built in Rust (using Axum and SocketIO) and a frontend powered by SolidJS. The backend leverages Golang‚Äôs high-performance capabilities, it also utilises WebSockets to offer a realtime communication among users of the application.

ByteChat is designed for scalability and concurrency, ideal for chat applications where multiple users require instant messaging. The backend handles numerous simultaneous connections, ensuring speed and reliability with Rust‚Äôs memory safety and performance.

### Key Features
- **Real-Time Communication**: Utilizing WebSockets for instant realtime, bidirectional communication.
- **Concurrency Handling**: Golang's concurrency features.
- **User Authentication**: The application utilises http only privately signed cookies to offer robust a session management and user authentication.
- **Message Persistence**: The application uses postgresql to save messages, and user information.
- **Robust and Scalable**: Built with Golang, ensuring a fast, secure, and scalable backend.
- **Dockerized Deployment**: Easily deploy ByteChat with Docker for a consistent environment.
